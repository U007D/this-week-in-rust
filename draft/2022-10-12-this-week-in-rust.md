### [Call for Testing](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing)
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.  The following
RFCs would benefit from user testing before moving forward:

* *No RFCs issued a call for testing this week.*

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear on the above list, add the new `call-for-testing`
label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature
need testing.

### [Approved RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/commits/master)

Changes to Rust follow the Rust [RFC (request for comments) process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs#rust-rfcs). These
are the RFCs that were approved for implementation this week:

* *No RFCs were approved this week.*

### Final Comment Period

which are reaching a decision. Express your opinions now.
