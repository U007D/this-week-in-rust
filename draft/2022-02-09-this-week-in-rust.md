## Crate of the Week

This week we have two crates: [update-informer](https://github.com/mgrachev/update-informer), a
library to embed an update check into your CLI project and
[blake3](https://crates.io/crates/blake3), a fast cryptographic hash function.

Thanks to [Grachev Mikhail](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1014) and 
[Zac Burns](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1014) for the suggestions!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

This was a relatively quiet week with regressions and improvements relatively equally each other out. The big exception is with a somewhat large regression in rustdoc which was needed for a large and important architectural change. This could lead to users see somewhat slower doc build times with more memory used especially in projects with large crate dependency graphs.

Triage done by **@rylev**.
Revision range: [c54dfee..1ea4851](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=c54dfee65126a0ac385d55389a316e89095a0713&end=1ea4851715893ee3f365a8ef09d47165e9a7864f&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

2 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 2 Mixed; 1 of them in rollups
35 comparisons made in total
