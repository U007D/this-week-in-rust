### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

A large amount of noise in the comparisons this week, likely due to new
probabilistic query hash verification increasing likelihood of changes in each
benchmark; solutions are being tracked in [rustc-perf#1105].

Otherwise, though, the week largely amounted to a neutral one for performance.
There were some regressions, particularly in doc builds, as a result of the
addition of portable SIMD. These are relatively speaking minor and primarily
impact small crates.

[rustc-perf#1105]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/issues/1105

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [eee8b9c7..934624f](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=eee8b9c7bafade55981d155dae71657f1cc55a22&end=934624fe5f66ce3fb8abf0597a6deb079783335f&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

5 Regressions, 2 Improvements, 6 Mixed; 2 of them in rollups

41 comparisons made in total

# Quote of the Week

> If a normal add is [a waffle iron ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_iron), SIMD add is a
> double or quadruple waffle iron. You can make 2 or 4 or more waffles at the same time.
>
> In case of waffles it would be called SIMW: **S** ingle **I** ron, **M** ultiple **W** affles.
>
> It's not multithreading - because you open and close the waffle iron for all the waffles at the
> same time.
