## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

* *No calls for testing were issued this week by [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/call-for-testing),
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/labels/call-for-testing) or
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/labels/call-for-testing).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

<!-- Call for Testing Message (post in GH `issue` and remove `call-for-testing` label) -->
This RFC will appear in the **Call for Testing** section of the next issue (#) of This Week in Rust (TWiR).

I have removed the `call-for-testing` label.  Please feel free to re-add the `call-for-testing` label if you would like this RFC to appear again in another issue of TWiR.
